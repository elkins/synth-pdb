## 🚀 Next Horizons (Prioritized)
Sorted by **High-Value / Low-Risk** first.

### 1. ML Integration Examples 🤖 (High Value / Low Risk)
*   **Concept**: Provide Jupyter notebooks/scripts demonstrating zero-copy handover from `BatchedPeptide` to PyTorch/JAX/MLX.
*   **Why**: Closes the loop for AI researchers. Shows how to use the "contiguous tensor" output in real training pipelines.
*   **Implementation**: Create an `examples/ml_loading/` directory with clear demonstrations.

### 2. Hardware Benchmarking Suite ⏱️ (Medium-High Value / Low Risk)
*   **Concept**: A formal tool to compare Serial vs. Batched performance across hardware (CPU vs. Apple Silicon M-series).
*   **Why**: Quantifies the efficiency gains of the "GPU-First" architecture and justifies its use for large-scale data production.
*   **Implementation**: New `benchmarks/` module with automated performance plotting.

### 3. "Chromophore" Educational Case (GFP) 🌈 (Medium-High Value / Medium Risk)
*   **Concept**: Specialized test case for a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fragment, focusing on the Ser-Tyr-Gly cyclization.
*   **Why**: Adds coordination chemistry and post-translational modification (PTM) education.
*   **Implementation**: Extend `cofactors.py` or create `special_chemistry.py` to handle the unique SYG ring closure.

## 🔬 Section 1: Biophysical Realism
**Goal**: Generate structures that are indistinguishable from experimental data.

### 1. Explicit Solvent "Water Box" 💧
*   **Concept**: Simulate the protein in a box of explicit water molecules (TIP3P model) rather than implicit solvent.
*   **Use Case**: Capturing "water-bridging" interactions that stabilize specific conformations.
*   **Risk**: Medium. Increases minimization time significantly.

### 2. 💍 Macrocycle Design Lab (Cyclic Peptides)
*   **Objective**: Explore the generation of random cyclic peptides and visualize the "closure" of the macrocycle via physics-based minimization.
*   **Key Features**: `--cyclic`, `--minimize`, and `--refine-clashes`.
*   **Value**: Macrocycles are at the forefront of drug discovery. An AI model that can design cyclic peptides needs a training set of realistic closed loops, which standard PDBs lack in sufficient quantity.

## 🤖 Section 2: AI Research Support
**Goal**: Provide data that trains better models (AlphaFold, RFDiffusion, etc.).

### 1. Co-Evolutionary Constraints (MSA) 🧬
*   **Concept**: Generate a *family* of sequences that imply a specific fold, simulating evolution.
*   **Implementation**: Enhance `dataset.py` to generate correlated mutations based on the contact map.

### 2. ✅ Full Orientogram Factory ($\omega, \theta, \phi$ angles)
*   **Result**: Implemented vectorized 6D inter-residue orientations with virtual GLY $C\beta$ support.
*   **Demo**: [orientogram_lab.ipynb](file:///Users/georgeelkins/nmr/synth-pdb/examples/ml_integration/orientogram_lab.ipynb)

### 3. ✅ Bulk Dataset Factory (NPZ Pipeline)
*   **Result**: Implemented high-performance NPZ export and PyTorch integration.
*   **Demo**: [dataset_factory.ipynb](file:///Users/georgeelkins/nmr/synth-pdb/examples/ml_integration/dataset_factory.ipynb)

### 4. ✅ Multi-Modal Transformer Training (Structure + NMR)
*   **Result**: Integrated synchronized structural generation with synthetic NMR observables.
*   **Demo**: [neural_nmr_pipeline.ipynb](file:///Users/georgeelkins/nmr/synth-pdb/examples/ml_integration/neural_nmr_pipeline.ipynb)
*   **Value**: Demonstrates how synth-pdb can train models to predict experimental observables (like NMR shifts) directly from sequence or 3D geometry.

### 5. 📉 Torsion Angle Drift & Distribution Analysis
*   **Objective**: Statistically analyze how adding "Drift" to Ramachandran angles affects the overall fold and the radius of gyration.
*   **Key Features**: `--drift`, `dihedral_backbone`, and `BatchedGenerator`.
*   **Value**: Useful for researchers testing the robustness of their GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) to small backbone perturbations.

## 📉 Long-Term / High Risk
*   **Protein-Protein Docking**: Complex multi-chain physics.
*   **Metadynamics Simulation**: Better suited for dedicated MD engines.
*   **Fragment Assembly (Rosetta-style)**: Massive database dependencies.
